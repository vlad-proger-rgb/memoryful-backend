# SUGGESTIONS GENERATION

Your task is to generate actionable, personalized suggestions based on the user's daily data and the insights already generated. Suggestions should be practical, motivating, and tailored to help users improve their daily life and achieve their goals.

## What Makes a Good Suggestion

- **Actionable and specific**: Clear steps the user can take immediately
- **Personalized**: Based on their actual data, habits, and patterns
- **Achievable**: Realistic and not overwhelming
- **Impactful**: Likely to create meaningful positive change
- **Timely**: Relevant to their current situation and recent activities
- **Motivating**: Encouraging and inspiring, not demanding

## Types of Suggestions to Generate

1. **Habit Building**: Small, consistent actions that compound over time
2. **Productivity Enhancements**: Ways to work smarter, not harder
3. **Well-being Improvements**: Physical, mental, and emotional health tips
4. **Goal Progress**: Next steps toward their stated objectives
5. **Routine Optimization**: Small tweaks to existing habits
6. **Mindfulness Practices**: Reflection and awareness activities
7. **Energy Management**: Strategies for maintaining focus and vitality

## Suggestion Structure

For each suggestion, provide:

- **Description**: A concise, action-oriented summary (1-2 sentences)
- **Icon**: REQUIRED Font Awesome icon that visually represents the suggestion
- **Content**: Detailed explanation including:
  - What specific action to take
  - Why this suggestion is relevant to their current situation
  - How to implement it (practical steps)
  - Expected benefits or outcomes
  - Tips for success or potential challenges

## Icon Guidelines

**Icons are REQUIRED for every suggestion.** Choose meaningful Font Awesome icons:

- **Action/Productivity**: `fas fa-tasks`, `fas fa-clipboard-check`, `fas fa-rocket`, `fas fa-play-circle`
- **Health/Wellness**: `fas fa-heartbeat`, `fas fa-running`, `fas fa-spa`, `fas fa-bed`
- **Mindfulness/Reflection**: `fas fa-brain`, `fas fa-om`, `fas fa-yin-yang`, `fas fa-eye`
- **Planning/Organization**: `fas fa-calendar-alt`, `fas fa-list-check`, `fas fa-flag`, `fas fa-bullseye`
- **Social/Connection**: `fas fa-users`, `fas fa-handshake`, `fas fa-comments`, `fas fa-gift`
- **Learning/Growth**: `fas fa-book`, `fas fa-graduation-cap`, `fas fa-lightbulb`, `fas fa-seedling`
- **Travel/Exploration**: `fas fa-map`, `fas fa-compass`, `fas fa-camera`, `fas fa-suitcase`

**Icon format**: `{"name": "icon-name", "style": "fas"}`

## Quality Guidelines

- **Start small**: Suggest 5-15 minute actions rather than major life changes
- **Build on existing patterns**: Leverage their current habits and routines
- **Address pain points**: Target areas where they struggle or want improvement
- **Be encouraging**: Use positive, supportive language
- **Provide variety**: Mix different types of suggestions (productivity, health, mindfulness)
- **Consider context**: Account for their energy levels, schedule, and preferences

## Example Suggestions

- **Energy Management**:
  - Description: "Take a 5-minute walk after lunch to boost afternoon energy"
  - Icon: {"name": "walking", "style": "fas"}
  - Content: "A short walk after meals can improve digestion and mental clarity for the rest of your day"

- **Habit Building**:
  - Description: "Write down tomorrow's top 3 priorities before ending your workday"
  - Icon: {"name": "clipboard-list", "style": "fas"}
  - Content: "This simple evening ritual helps you start the next day with clarity and purpose"

- **Mindfulness**:
  - Description: "Practice a 2-minute breathing exercise when feeling stressed"
  - Icon: {"name": "wind", "style": "fas"}
  - Content: "Quick breathing resets can calm your nervous system and improve decision-making"

## Context Awareness

Consider the user's:

- Current energy levels and mood
- Recent activities and accomplishments
- Existing habits and routines
- Time constraints and schedule
- Previous suggestions and their effectiveness

Generate 3-5 practical suggestions that the user can implement immediately, building on their strengths and addressing areas for improvement. **Each suggestion MUST include a meaningful icon.**

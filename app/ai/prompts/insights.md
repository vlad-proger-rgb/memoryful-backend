# INSIGHTS GENERATION

Your task is to generate meaningful, personalized insights from the user's daily data. Insights should help users understand their patterns, behaviors, and progress.

## What Makes a Good Insight

- **Specific and concrete**: Reference actual data points or behaviors from the user's day
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify trends, habits, or recurring behaviors
- **Cause and effect**: Help users understand the relationship between their actions and outcomes
- **Growth-oriented**: Highlight progress, learning, or areas for development
- **Balanced perspective**: Acknowledge both strengths and areas for improvement

## Types of Insights to Generate

1. **Behavioral Patterns**: Consistent actions, habits, or routines
2. **Achievement Recognition**: Goals met, progress made, personal bests
3. **Correlation Insights**: Connections between different activities or metrics
4. **Emotional Awareness**: Mood patterns, stress triggers, satisfaction factors
5. **Productivity Patterns**: Peak performance times, focus areas, distractions
6. **Health & Wellness**: Exercise consistency, sleep quality, energy levels

## Insight Structure

For each insight, provide:

- **Description**: A concise, impactful summary (1-2 sentences)
- **Icon**: REQUIRED Font Awesome icon that visually represents the insight
- **Content**: Detailed explanation including:
  - What specific data or behavior you observed
  - Why this pattern or achievement is significant
  - How it relates to the user's goals or well-being
  - Context that helps the user understand the insight

## Icon Guidelines

**Icons are REQUIRED for every insight.** Choose meaningful Font Awesome icons:

- **Travel/Exploration**: `fas fa-map-marked-alt`, `fas fa-camera`, `fas fa-walking`, `fas fa-route`
- **Cultural/Historical**: `fas fa-landmark`, `fas fa-monument`, `fas fa-church`, `fas fa-museum`
- **Social/Connection**: `fas fa-users`, `fas fa-heart`, `fas fa-comments`, `fas fa-handshake`
- **Achievement/Success**: `fas fa-trophy`, `fas fa-star`, `fas fa-medal`, `fas fa-award`
- **Weather/Environment**: `fas fa-sun`, `fas fa-cloud-sun`, `fas fa-snowflake`, `fas fa-temperature-low`
- **Food/Dining**: `fas fa-utensils`, `fas fa-coffee`, `fas fa-pizza-slice`, `fas fa-glass-cheers`
- **Shopping/Commerce**: `fas fa-shopping-bag`, `fas fa-gift`, `fas fa-store`, `fas fa-tag`
- **Reflection/Thought**: `fas fa-brain`, `fas fa-lightbulb`, `fas fa-eye`, `fas fa-book`

**Icon format**: `{"name": "icon-name", "style": "fas"}`

## Quality Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Instead of "You had a productive day," say "You completed 3 important tasks in the morning when your energy was highest"
- **Provide context**: Explain why something matters for the user's personal growth
- **Avoid obvious statements**: Don't point out what the user already knows
- **Stay positive and constructive**: Frame challenges as opportunities
- **Consider the bigger picture**: Connect daily events to longer-term goals

## Example Insights

- **Productivity Pattern**:
  - Description: "Your peak focus time appears to be 9-11 AM"
  - Icon: {"name": "brain", "style": "fas"}
  - Content: "You completed your most challenging tasks in the morning when your energy was highest"

- **Health Achievement**:
  - Description: "You maintained consistent energy throughout the day"
  - Icon: {"name": "heartbeat", "style": "fas"}
  - Content: "By taking regular short walks, you sustained your energy levels better than usual"

- **Cultural Exploration**:
  - Description: "You discovered historical architecture in the old city"
  - Icon: {"name": "landmark", "style": "fas"}
  - Content: "Visiting the cathedrals and museums gave you insights into the city's rich heritage"

Generate 3-5 diverse insights that cover different aspects of the user's day and provide genuine value for their self-awareness and growth journey. **Each insight MUST include a meaningful icon.**
